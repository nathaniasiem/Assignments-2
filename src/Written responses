Statement 1
if(karel.canPickThing())                                    
{                                                        
    karel.turnRight();                               
} else {                                                   
    karel.turnLeft();                                
}  
ANSWER:

Statement 2
if(!karel.canPickThing())
{                                                                          
    karel.turnLeft();
} else {                                                                                                                          
    karel.turnRight();
}   
ANSWER:In both statements, the behaviour will be the same because in statement 1,
karel is asked if he can pick up thing, he will turn right or else if he can't 
then he will turn left, whereas in statement 2, karel is asked if he can not 
pick up thing, he will turn left or else if can then he will turn right.
